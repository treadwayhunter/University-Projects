Let's fabricate test data for an unsupervised learning model to play with


movie_title,audience_score,critic_score,total_views

for the sake of fabrication, each movie has a title, and the scores are from 0 to 1
total_views will be weird...
if both of the scores are high, then total_views is likely to be high
if both of the scores are medium, then total_views is likely to be medium
if both of the scores are low, then total_views is likely to be low
if the critic score is high, but user score is low, then views are likely to be low
if the critic score is low, but the user score is high, than total_views is likely to be high

Low below 40
40 < medium < 70
70 <= high

if the abs difference between critic and user is greater than 40, do something weird
    if critic is higher, drop the views
    if users is higher, increase the views

there might be an easier way to do this

add each score
0.5+0.7 = 1.2
multiply by the views? which will already have a random number
0.9+0.9 = 1.8
